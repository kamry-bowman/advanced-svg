## An exploration in SVG animation

This site was built while exploring the potentials for animating svg files on a website. The site consists of a view of a cabin as it transitions from night to day. There are controls to change the speed of the day's progress, as well as moving a timeline slider manually. Techniques used were thosed described in Sarah Drasner's Advanced SVG course from Front End Masters.

## Technology Used
The static scene was built in Inkscape, and then SVGs were optimized using Jake Archibald's [https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/](SVGOMG). Animations were built with the Green Socket animation library.
